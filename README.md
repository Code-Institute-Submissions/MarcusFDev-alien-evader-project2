# Alien Evader

[Alien Evader](https://marcusfdev.github.io/alien-evader-project2/) has been designed as a cartoon platformer game. Users control a little alien attempting to evade their parent's spaceship as long as they can using the building rooftops. Users can build up score the longer they remain uncaught, they are to be mindful however, the longer they remain evading, the faster the chase becomes. 

The site has been themed alongside the game and is aimed to be responsive on all devices with the addition of a Feedback form, so users can send in their own ideas with the goal of community building.

## Visual Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes: 

### Fonts

![Site Font Example](assets/images/site-images/site-font-example.png)

 - The primary font used on the website & game assets was [Madimi One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Madimi+One). This font was chosen as the main font because it really gave off the impression it felt at place with cartoon style graphics. It's bubble like appearance really sat well with the other graphics on the page while maintaining a certain level of professionalism. On a practical note, the font is clear & easy to read on all devices and is not harsh on the eyes in any way. While there are other fonts with similiar styles Madimi One was picked to be the best for the job. The font styles well for all text on the page as by design, large bodies of text are not common on the Alien Evader site instead relying on a graphical and simplistic approach. 

 - The secondary font for the website [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) was picked for it's easy readability and playful style. It is not harsh to look at, and when styled correctly using higher values it looks very alike the primary font's style. It is inviting to all users and fits the cartoon style of the site almost as well.

### Icons

![Site Icon Example](assets/images/site-images/site-icon-example.png)

 -  Icons used throughout the website were taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) icon library. They are utilized in the `<i>` tag.
 -  Icons are used in the navigational Bar & Footer as well as in other assets and pages on the site such as thankyou.html & the 404.html page. They were used to create a more visually appealing site. Appropriate use of icons was done to also visually help users navigate the webpages.

# Alien Evader

[Alien Evader](https://marcusfdev.github.io/alien-evader-project2/) has been designed as a cartoon platformer game. Users control a little alien attempting to evade their parent's spaceship as long as they can using the building rooftops. Users can build up score the longer they remain uncaught, they are to be mindful however, the longer they remain evading, the faster the chase becomes. 

The site has been themed alongside the game and is aimed to be responsive on all devices with the addition of a Feedback form, so users can send in their own ideas with the goal of community building.
